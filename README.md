# Resume ATS Score Checker App

Struggling to get your resume noticed by employers? This simple app helps you analyze your resume and check how well it matches a job description based on ATS (Applicant Tracking System) criteria.

## Features:

ðŸ“„ Upload your resume in PDF format.

ðŸ“‹ Enter a job description you're applying for.

ðŸŽ¯ Get an ATS match percentage and suggestions for missing keywords.

ðŸš€ Tailor your resume for better chances of getting shortlisted.

## Why I Built This:

As a job seeker, I faced the same challenge of getting my resume through ATS filters. I built this tool to solve that problem for myself, but I realized that many others are in the same position. Thatâ€™s why I decided to share this app with the community.

## How It Works:

Upload your resume and enter the job description.

The app evaluates your resume against the job description using AI (Google Gemini).

It provides a percentage match and a list of missing keywords to help you improve your resume.

## Important Note:

The AI model used (Google Gemini) is not 100% accurate, but it provides useful insights to guide you in improving your resume.
You will need to use your own Google API key to operate this tool.

## How to Use:

Clone this repository:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ats-resume-checker.git

Install the dependencies.

Follow the instructions to set up your own API key and start using the app!
